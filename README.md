# wifi-userseg-ryu

This code contains the RYU repository with a userseg.py app for segregation of users over wifi from the access point instead of a wifi controller.

File located inside ryu app folder.
Run as you would for a normal ryu application.


The included OpenWrt Backup contains the necessary configurations for TP Link WDR4300 V1.3 with which the code is built upon.
